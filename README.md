# State Server!

Vistar serves up a mound of geospatial data both internally and to third
parties. What we need is a server to tell us which state, if any, a point is in.
Some simplified geometries are included in states.json (so greatly simplified,
that some of the smaller ones disappear).

It need not be fast, but the code should be readable, and the results should be
correct.

## Expected Behavior

  $ ./state-server &
  [1] 21507
  $ curl  -d "longitude=-77.036133&latitude=40.513799" http://localhost:8080/
  ["Pennsylvania"]
  $


## Notes

Given that file, it took one of us about an hour to implement something that
worked correctly. You're welcome to take it however far you want, but we're
expecting something along those lines.

And if there's anything special we have to do to run your program, just let us
know. A Makefile never hurt anyone.

## Steps

-> Download the zip file and extract it
-> open project in VS code and run "npm install" in your terminal
-> then run "npm run start" or "node stateserver.js" in your terminal
-> When you will see like "Server is up on port 8080"
-> Git bash to your project folder and run those steps provided in "Results.docx" you will see the given output.
